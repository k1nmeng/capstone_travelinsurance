# __Overview__

This project showcases what I learned at the Vertical Institute's Data Analytics bootcamp in 2024. The program provided me with foundational skills in data cleaning 
using Excel, data querying with SQL, and data visualization through Tableau.

My capstone project focused on travel insurance, utilizing a dataset I acquired from Kaggle. I began by downloading the CSV files and performing data cleaning in Excel 
before importing the prepared data into Tableau Desktop for comprehensive visualization.
